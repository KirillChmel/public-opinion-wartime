## Project Details

While the information on public opinion is essential for all sides of the conflict, the question of the validity of surveys conducted during wartime remains open to interpretation. Estimates of the level of support for military actions can be skewed because of social desirability or selection bias. Grim political climate of authoritarian regimes can also exacerbate the issue by making respondents even less willing to express their honest opinions. In this paper, we aim to answer the question of whether the Russian citizens “genuinely” support the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We measure the support for the invasion using an experiment-based approach known as item-count technique and statistical simulation - multilevel regression with poststratification - to adjust the estimates for potential biases. Both approaches demonstrate that the estimate based on respondents’ answers to the direct question is unbiased. Nevertheless, this estimate was found to hide a significant portion of sub-national variation, meaning that the support for the invasion is not as unanimous as presented by pollsters.
